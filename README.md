# MSPNN

we propose a new framework, the multi-semantic pathway network (MSPNN) for fake face detection. This method comprehensively captures   forged information from the dimensions of microscopic, mesoscopic, and macroscopic features. These three kinds of semantic information are given learnable weights. The artifacts of deepfake images are more difficult to   observe in a compressed   video. Therefore,  preprocessing   is proposed to detect low-quality deepfake videos, including multiscale detail enhancement and channel information screening based on the compression principle.
